Nicolas Nassim Taleb, a notable bicycle enthusiast, writes of opportunities missed to fulfill broad long-range ambitions because we fail to grasp and stack short-term credits (good things); they *look* like 'work' (generally considered a bad thing - a debit)  unless, in our civilization, they are done as part of an agreement (just as an employment contract) in which case you get paid compensation for the toil and trouble.

I grew up a working class boy in an environment where 'many hands make light work' was a dictum put to consistent practice in my dad's shop. I've been working more or less in one way or another since I was five or six years old. The frugal habits of the newly grateful middle class were drilled into me. As well the culture of self-improvement through application in book learning characteristic of my so-called 'people'. For me however that learning extended into developing credibility in how I presented myself my physicality included to the broader world as something more than a 'model minority'. I craved instead to be 'fit for my country' (England - writ large as its broad diaspora of heritage). You miss how well incidental physical activity keeps you looking good until your circumstances change; i.e. when you can afford those trappings of 'conspicuous affluence' that aren't quite an aspect of conspicuous consumption but still offer a moment where you feel 'you've arrived'. A good example is walking into a beautiful resort town hotel and letting the 'help' take your bags to the room leaning into the moment of luxury your family is enjoying.

In an echo of that moment in *Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder* Taleb critiques modern thoughtless versions of effort and health — a man hires a porter to carry his luggage, then goes to the gym to lift weights; like this we constantly forego opportunities to exert meaningful and useful labor and then artificially simulate it later in controlled, sterile environments.

Dawkins’ “selfish gene” suggests energy conservation as a survival trait, but in modern society it mutates into pathology. What was once adaptive idleness now feeds short-termism, comfort-seeking, and distracted posing — instincts easily exploited by systems that profit from our urge to fit in and 'move on up'.

Having found that savouring the high of such moments entails a come down, I opt for what I call a path of most (POM) resistance; taking the more strenuous route to comfort that at the very least holds the possibility of fun and almost certainly personal growth. This isn't about self-denial but rather asking the question: is there an alternative that holds the prospect of a greater good that I haven't seen - one that actually makes me feel better. Walking instead of riding the train or fasting while out instead of dining (alone) has too within it something of "propaganda as deed". It's a strike or a sanction against the sovereign and his systems as I make metaphorical salt. It is my satyagraha. Instead of walking a straight path on a clear barren climate-controlled corridor, I take the trail with weather and many distractions. The journey is the thing so I immerse myself in each moment wherever I am and see how I might profit in information or money *saved*. You pay for things *after* taxes remember. It's best not to bother even making the money in the first place - especially if there's even a moment of futility in the toil you do for it. It's best to find the enjoyment that comes from not spending what you have. Work or anything really that requires effort demands an explanation that has nothing to do with money.

Philosophical Anarchism is the idea of assuming responsibility and accountability at home (wherever you are) regardless of whether the rest of the commons gives one you an incentive to do so. I've frame the opportunity in terms of political and radical dissent but you can also, if you prefer, look at it in more playful constructive terms. Imagination and vision makes these opportunities to own and manipulate your behaviour instead of absent-mindedly surrendering it to profiteers. You'll come to relish the creativity and play that enters your life. 

A couple of decades ago on my first at home-only assignment I grew a bit fat and even pre-diabetic (genes making me susceptible to Type 2 Diabetes). In response I started running upstairs through the day to our ensuite bathroom to urinate. Problem solved - I'd stack up 10 or 15 flights a day. Even now, I still sometimes absent-mindedly launch myself in a playful sprint upstairs. On the potty (I sit because I'm lazy and don't want to wash my hands this way) my mouth still closed, I'd assess my recovery; could I return to a normal cadence before I stopped pissing? I've actually graduated from that particular habit now to urinate outdoors. It saves me a flush and the testosterone marks a perimeter for critters to respect.

Am I concerned about appearances? No. The more curious or 'weird' things you're able to do for good reasons that can be explained the better:  I train surf in the aisle on my commute - standing without support balancing as if I were on a surfboard. it's playful especially coming from a 50-something. Kids giggle and onlookers crack a smile. If I'm early for the train I walk along the platform picking up litter. Why not? 

This path of most resistance actuates desirable outcomes for individuals and communities - as well as as benefiting the environment. Let's take a look at riding my bicycle instead of driving. That's an easy one:

- **The Self:**  Exercise and the contentment, self-esteem, and attractiveness well beyond your physical appearance that comes with it

- **The Commons:** Less road congestion and lower prices through suppressed demand for good and services - insurance, maintenance, gasoline, healthcare costs; the availability of scarce parking for those who need them

- **The Environment**: Reduced carbon emissions and air pollution - ameliorating the impact on climate change

Things that make common sense are contagious and go viral in the real world. That said people want *their* positive vibes quickly so lock-up your bikes - there's a difference between attraction and temptation that we all struggle to grasp at times. That path of least resistance is can be a hard one to pass up. I do my best to resist the temptation. Being self-sovereign doesn't give us a license to break rules or laws in society. You still get only get what everyone else is entitled to - this is about what you *post* by foregoing on those entitlements and maybe once in a while picking up responsibilities others can't.

>London never sleeps, it just sucks
>The life out of me, show some dignity honey
>Sushi bars, wet fish, it just sucks
>The life out of me, and the money from my pocket
>~ Catatonia (Londinium)

Without much imagination one might think of the path of *most* resistance as a honey pot that generates a streams of 'in kind' micropayment. I call this 'dignity honey' - it arises from the careful investment of attention and intention in the moment delivering real monetary benefit even if it's not immediately manifested as money.

It's not much of a leap to imagine a world where an identity stack (A Stone Rose) of self-sovereign data might be utilized by a person to generate real income from the commons (government) for behaviour that mitigates costs to the public purse and the ecology while improving life on consensus-driven terms (Hour Glass Redcurrant). All of this evolving the world with right action that produces alignment (Yoga Element). These are the kinds of applications we're working on in the Solana eco-system and they'll be enabled by changes arriving to the frameworks used to transmit fiat money - ones that facilitate the transfer of the tiniest amounts streamed at virtually zero cost. Your life minding your business will become a real business; you'll be an entrepreneur guided to opportunities that exploit your particular talent (Calling) to be a Dial Square (a semper idem) uniquely positioned, like a sundial, to get a read on and respond to even a random and ordinary opportunity to make the world better. 

## Back Pedaling ##

In my own life, I have looked and felt the best when I've owned a bicycle and used it as my primary mode of transportation. I learned young and my first job was delivering papers on my Raleigh Grifter on North London's North Circular and Cambridge Roads. In 1982, my year rediscovering my Indian heritage, I rode across Vadodara to and from school each day with a gang of friends. It's how I got around at Western; I rode home (to Toronto) once with a crew from the Cycling Club

After Uni, I headed off to Japan where I whizzed through the streets and hillsides of Wakayama Prefecture or sub-urban Tokyo carving myself into wicked shape. I was on a bike at grad school in Ottawa coursing through the lanes along the Rideau Canal or tricking down campus steps.

The term *Ars Technica* or Art of Technology implies that profoundly important technology can instill the kind of long-lived affection of emotional attachment. That's because good design is an intrinsic part of highly functioning apparatus. We can become highly possessive of our favourite kit as individuals but also as a people or more broadly as humanity. Trains are one that elicits jealous affection from a now tiny but still persistent group of trainspotting anoraks. Certain model of vehicle which are particularly well-made or just seem to have a personality about them - the Toyota Pickup for example or the Mini Cooper. Then there's the bicycle. Substantively unchanged, for some 150 years. The bicycle as it is now was first made in England when John Kemp Starley invented the [Rover]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_bicycle

## Black Boy On Moped ##

In simple terms Anarchism relates to minimalism around things in much the same way it relates to relationships with people. Generally speaking we can only be truly close and trust a relatively small number: a maximum of 150 or so. Beyond that you're delegating trust and alignment on values. In the Corporate world of passively traded publicly held firms whose original founders can no longer dictate robust standards for quality we're asking bureaucratic administrators to assemble us however they wish - in whatever way suits their ends and objective. It's why so many are often frustrated at the prospect of work on Monday. As an alternative, anarchism has us approach interactions with the deep awareness and clear intentions with an optimistic faith in the potential for mutual and fair benefit that is additive to the world beyond the immediate transaction.

During the lockdown, as I peeled away from corporate life and began to retool for Act III and I bought the Babymaker, drawn to its curious name that to me at least unabashedly expressed the essence of creativity and passion: Even when we're not making babies literally we'll talk about some cherished project in those terms and we apply ourselves to them accordingly. That means, above all, creating space in our lives for them reductively.

I sold my 15 year-old motorcycle and my 13 year-old pick-up, streamlining my needs and reducing costs. The house too is up for sale. As well, after a long hiatus, I came back to the bicycle and the very real prospect of nomadism - the expression of my Generation X personality in this Fourth Turning as we radically pare down our dependency on the prevailing *default* political-economy. 

As with people, so with things: We bring and keep what we love while the 'Universe' works to remove those things we can no longer keep: Either because we can no longer afford them or they have greater appeal as capital - our objectives and how we measure them evolving and invariably becoming more about quality than quantity. This awakening is as much about knowing my own station in life as anything else: I am beginning my Act III - the 30-year homestretch that returns me to the Universal. I expect to end it as the Iroquois who once occupied this space did - with scarcely a thing to my name.

Bicycles are compact and economical and fit Henry Ford's anarchist standard: "Any colour you want as long as it's black". My Babymaker's electric battery and powertrain simplifies instrumentation, removing gears and their various moving parts. In return I'm offered battery-powered acceleration that maintains cruising speed on hills and allows me to launch into open straights with exhilaration as road conditions and traffic allows. It's a thrill being a part of the scene again rather than trapped inside a box staring into traffic waiting for answers to existential questions and green lights. I feel like the all-American Modern English Indo-Aryan - the Apache Rose Peacock - and there's never been a better time that right now:
