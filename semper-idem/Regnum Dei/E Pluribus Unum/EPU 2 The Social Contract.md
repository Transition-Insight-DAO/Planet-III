**Contract**: The word carries the sense of a wheel or weal — a means by which we move together (*con~tract*) across shared ground to create wealth, a positive sum for all parties involved. Contracts operate within a sovereign context — the law, the government, or the Crown — whose responsibility is to ensure that the interests of the environment, or *the commons*, are protected.

When these sovereigns fail to acknowledge facts or assume that responsibility, the result is the familiar *tragedy of the commons*. I also refer to this third, often neglected party as *Creation*, to draw a clear distinction from the sovereign, which — quite undeservedly — is sometimes held to be synonymous with the commons. For all the government’s claims to safeguard Creation when it exercises its right of *eminent domain*, it generally does so for the purse — its own or the private purses of those who sponsor incumbent officers with material support.

Yet the sovereign edifice remains slow to evolve, resistant to the very innovations required to safeguard Creation. This is partly because, in practice, those who serve within these structures are rarely visionaries; they are administrators and careerists performing a role. Thus arises a conflict between their interest in maintaining their sinecure and the performance of it to the satisfaction of the general public.



## Introduction

Part Two of *E Pluribus Unum* explores the concept of contract — and in particular, the social contract, which governs how we agree to behave in society. Part One, *Leviathan*, examined what passes for leadership in Western liberal democracies: how it is constituted, bounded, and positioned relative to the rest of the world. One unspoken mythology of Western democracy is that of meritocracy: institutions, it is claimed, operate within a system (capitalism) that automatically elevates the most capable individuals, in a free marketplace of ideas rigorously examined by attentive citizens.

In practice, this myth collides with the reality of governing large, complex nation-states. Processes must appear to function consistently, yet scale and complexity make this impossible. Rules and strictures are imposed at considerable cost to ensure disciplined procedural oversight, while allowances and exceptions are made to keep governance manageable — often undermining that very oversight. Compounding this is the imperative to maintain the prestige, esteem and security of officeholders and institutions in a competitive, adversarial global context. All of this serves to cast leadership as a coddled coterie rather than a representative meritocracy.

The result is a growing separation — a psychic distancing — between the state (Leviathan) and those it governs, producing an inevitable erosion of trust and legitimacy. Surveys, such as those by Pew Research Center, show that public confidence in both public and private institutions have steadily declined since the 1950s. While few doubt the good intentions of senior leaders in public or private institutions, systemic compromises and fiduciary pressures create mounting tension on the social contract — the implicit agreement about how we treat each other. Broken promises, particularly the idea of upward mobility — that diligence, curiosity, and creativity will be rewarded — highlight the contract’s fragility.

Yet there is an adaptive mechanism built into society: a kind of dialectic in pluralist systems that allows innovation to persist outside incumbent structures. New ideas can then diffuse into the social contract, enabling governance to evolve — or, as I suggested in Part One, devolve — outward from the Leviathan to the periphery, ultimately empowering individuals to govern themselves without permanent intermediaries.

This second part explores the qualities of a well-functioning contract: one that executes processes consistently, predictably, and deterministically. Such contracts — particularly those capable of operating autonomously, on-chain, or algorithmically — may be central to the devolution of governance to the self-sovereign individual  As well they are critical to the long-term resilience of human civilization sustainably on our planet as the transparency with privacy and security enabled allow optimal outcomes: In technical terms, maximal extractable (legitimate and credible) value. The bias or normative *preference* systemically embedded within such contracts amount to aligning self-interests with those of the commons (sovereign) and the ecology without compromise so that human civilization and culture may persist and flourish indefinitely without degrading the planet.

Contracts are created as a utility (an instrument or tool) to allow complex civilizations to flourish. The word is derived from Latin. The prefix *con~* from *cum* (meaning together) while the term tract is from *trahere* meaning to draw, pull, or drag. So a contract is a means for us to come together to gain traction and manifest a sum positive result for mutual benefit: Something greater than that we would have achieved separately. Therefore contracts are *creative* and in a practical sense they facilitate generation, productivity or if you will, a form fertility; the creation of something apparently from nothing except the seed of an idea expressed through an interaction; you will note the synchronicity drawn from the primal reality of that moment of intercourse when a human life itself begins. This *seminal* moment of creation extends into the rest of our lives and it is why the discovery of one's *Calling* is important; turning us from the anguished scream of repressed identity to instead a discovery of our primal selves so that we may manifest productive outcomes. Calling (in civil society) amounts to a contract with the all reality to discover a utility amidst the perceived reality to affect change and manifest order (incrementally evolving the chaos of our human systems into something resembling the anarchy which prevails in the rest of nature). Ultimately a life is balanced through its ending. Its value to the commons and to creation is settled by legacy (i.e. what is left). For humanity as a species, if one imagines that it has a contract with the universe, the matter at hand is what will be left if that contract is terminated. We each have scope for being agents of change based on our circumstances at birth. From that point onwards we learn what it means to exist and as well about the nature of the world, our society and humanity as a whole. The universe has its *effect* on us with each perceived moment as an incoming transaction. Our 'balance of account' with it is determined by how we each in turn respond to that transaction to *affect* change. This is what we call accountability and it is evident regardless of whether one is immediately held responsible for their actions or not. What we find most galling invariably is a lack of due consideration; a failure to respond to what we have been 'handed' by it with something not only objectively meaningful but also appropriate and fair considering our unique talents. From each according to our ability and to each according to their needs: how we respond to that exhortation amounts to whether we are, from our unique place in a moment of what we call history, leading or not. Only we personally may discover our Calling is and manifest; doing so is to make ourselves content while extracting ever less of a cost from the universe in material terms for it. That is in fact the very definition of productivity and what it is to *be* the means of production from an entirely personal standpoint. In that sense yo                              u are a 'node' within a network of transactional behaviour endowed with a 'mound' of relative trust or the 'tell' of a positive balance. You may then be said to have social credit: a positive balance of due consideration paid in kind to society. You hold yourself accountable by owning that balance while being perfectly content with your circumstances and without seeking 'token' recognition of any kind (the payment of even a compliment). One's life and work is its own reward and one's circumstances amounts to what 'just is': that which amounts to fairness and balance in our world. Those content with our governance deem it to be *systemically* fair. They will aim to affect positive change from within it. From the anarchist's perspective, there appears to be a discrepancy in account keeping and some room for improvement in system design.









 This is what we call liberal society: one within which a broad definition of acceptable behaviour is allowed for in our private lives but one within which we still need to extend the protection of the law to the most vulnerable where they are unseen.





by others towards the peace, order and good government, such as it is that we have created in our mechanisms for governance, in *broad daylight*. In society in plain view of others we are generally held accountable for our transgressions. 

When we are no longer able to hold our sovereign accountable for what we deem to be transgressions, we fork and choose to 



Whether you or I hold ourselves responsible for assuring we are accountable. 







 However, regardless of how life unfolds we have agency to choose our response to in turn *affect* change from wherever we are.





For those who feel that with ethics (liberalism) as a component of a life lived pragmatically in the political economy in the world  (realism), all one can do is live a life which is minimally extractive and yet positive as an experience of embodiment.

Legal contracts are drawn up to stipulate explicit terms: “If this, then that.” The structure is conditional, encoding obligations that arise from envisioned opportunities, which in turn enable the enjoyment of rights to a share of a fruitful outcome. There is a clearly defined cause and effect between obligation and right with the former preceding and resulting in another. So much for explicitly defined contracts.

As a component of what we might comprehensively denote as the *social contract*, in addition to the explicit legal contracts we are obligated to observe there are *social norms*. These introduce the idea of what we have implicitly agreed to be acceptable but not necessarily a matter of law and are matters of good behaviour, decorum and taste. They also introduce areas where discretion may be applied; for example in a familiar context amongst people with the capacity of providing informed *consent*: for example, competent parents serving alcohol alongside meals to their adolescent children technically be minors under the law. 



## Conscience

*How we each individually negotiate the expression of social norms is critical to our relative social credit in civil society* and as well in the aggregate, it determines how well civil society functions. We filter social norms through conscience. The lines our conscience draws dictates what we hold to be negotiable and non-negotiable as individuals as we interact or transact with another person. While we cannot easily dictate to others how they express themselves in a free society it remains the case that these societies are bounded within a realm (a physical space) for the purposes of governance within which laws are enforced to allow 

 without being coercive nor has it always been possible to depart from them in the expression of our own behaviour even when our conscience dictated. 

Many for example will pragmatically accept the injustices of slavery, segregation, apartheid or sexism as the price of claiming and holding a space within the system from within; inevitably however their evident disenchantment and abstention from  the social norms they cannot abide will set them apart from the incumbency. The slightest disaffection will soon be noted and soon enough they are cast out - if they do not themselves withdraw first.

Withdrawal from contracts whose social norms routinely fail to meet the dictates of conscience is crucial — both for personal wellbeing and for the potential recovery of the system itself. Conscience cannot be ignored for long without exacting a heavy cost on one’s sense of self and even on one’s health. The word itself — *conscientia* — means “to know together,” a shared recognition of basic facts. The dictates of conscience differ in degree, but not in kind, from the fundamental principles that govern reality — physics, chemistry — and are deeply rooted in biology. We ignore them at our peril because the steady incremental evolution of our civilization is founded on the acknowledgement of basic facts otherwise the system is itself slowly becomes more unstable and require ever more compromises concerning what we are willing to let pass as 'bare acceptable behaviour'. Increasingly it no longer models or frame a field of reference within people are willing to live, quite simply because it accepts without remorse or recourse too many arbitrarily unfair outcomes.

Conscience may be seen as the internal mechanism that speaks for creation, the ecology, or integrated holistic intelligence as we navigate interactions in the world. It seeks to preserve liveness in all forms and to keep our own animus bounded within reason. Yet conscience falters, and animus arises, when *perceived* scarcity mars rational thought — resulting in its emotional counterparts fear and anger. This sense of scarcity originates in a cognitive assessment: a calculation that wealth, opportunities, or *time* are limited. In civil society, particularly in the liberal democratic west, the idea of scarcity also extend to entirely notional concepts, such as title, status, reputation or relative wealth - certainly for those who aspire to upward mobility. 

When our cleverest physicists opt for roles in finance as quants instead of building the apparatus required to explore and understand the universe we are being sent a clear distress signal about social norms. As well when instead of opting to spend time in creative pursuits whether it be planting, building, teaching, nursing or even in the arts our young choose blandly administrative roles that bestow some title and (what appears for the time being at least) a handsome salary. What this amounts to is unbounded animus wrought universally; whereas creativity, the place where risk and reward meet at one's *Calling* is the lifeblood of human civilization, we instead opt *wholesale* for the perceived safety of sinecure; the result is stagnation for us as individuals, for society and civilization itself. Moreover, the resulting inexplicable disquiet is invariably settled with hedonistic consumption resulting in the rapid depletion of our finite resource and the ravaging of the very environment we once depended up on for our mere subsistence.

Particularly troubling is that these circumstances accompany a widening disparity in outcomes for people in western society as wealth, income inequality and the so-called diseases of civilization (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, chronic stress) leave increasingly large numbers of people fearful and panicked at the prospect of very real *scarcity* (malnutrition and illness) for the first time since the Great Depression.

What we have then is a polarized escalation of animus both among increasingly static middle class and the poorest. Meanwhile those comfortably ensconced in positions of authority perceiving rising volatility and civil unrest ramp up their perimeter, surveillance and security apparatus. Each segment of society anticipating and pre-emptively *reacting* to animus from another propels an escalating cycle of chaos.

All the while of course we sense the world coming apart because our administrative classes appear increasingly spontaneous in their generation of policy responses. If they are market focused their only objective is revenue and the current quarter.  As well, more to the point, rather than guide our collective towards creative pursuits to resolve our long-lasted 'productivity conundrum' they are instead mired in a competitive race to accumulate and express opulent consumption; then serving it up to the world as evidence of great ability and accomplishment.

Meanwhile, having grown disenchanted real creative talent checks out.

 best and most creative check out to express themselves in the arising parallel system designed, with the self-enforcing discipline of transparency, to manifest providence.



## Providence











and in my estimation is beginning to fail across vast number of us is when exhaustion sets in with materialistic ambitions of those who occupy high office, that is, those I referred in Part 1 as comprising Leviathan.

A *sense of scarcity* can arise from cognitive assessment — your mind calculating that resources, opportunities, or time are limited.
 It’s a **rational perception**, often tied to survival logic:

- “There isn’t enough food / money / attention / status to go around.”
- “If I don’t act now, I’ll lose out.”



## Providence

Once again the key idea in contracts, and of course this includes social contracts is they result in sum positive outcomes.

## 























Think of a society, not as complex as ours but still orderly and structured. Those of our indigenous communities. Or the first societies which formed; ones with *implicit* rules rather than the explicit ones we have today (i.e. law). Obligations, except for the very young *always* precede rights. For example you cannot claim a *rightful* share of gathered and hunted victual without first having participated and asserted *some* talent to express the feeling that you want to belong to a community. Invariably you will introspect on what that may be as you scan your immediate surroundings to find a gap that needs to be filled; a reality or truth which needs to be adjusted to align better with what your nascent community requires as it seeks comfort. In economy, you are *obligated* to stake a investment in order to affect a *return* on investment. In our health and welfare we are obligated to invest time, effort and care in relative youth to reap the return of a relatively comfortable old age.

Now we may hallucinate in a moment of inconsiderateness, perhaps prompted by fear or a sense of scarcity, to model our reality differently. It seems trite and simplistic for example but simply using the term 'rights and obligations', placing the effect before the cause may have a profound and rippling impact on how we govern our relationships and transactions with one another. However, nor are rights and obligations enjoyed *simultaneously*. 

















The implication for a *social* contract is that through our connectedness to each other we lift and ride with each other out of the world in its bare original state to derive comfort* (which means 'together strong' if you analyse the term for its etymology in Latin). we need to live well enough to pursuit contentment; whatever fate allows in our circumstances based on what we are afforded by each other. Intuitively this should make sense to you as you look around. The heating, lighting, the building you are in keep you comfortable and you are unlikely to have been self-sufficient in the provisioning of these. As well throughout history, the breakdown of legitimacy or the social contract is made evident by the failure of basic processes or utilities long taken for granted: electrical failures and water shortages for example. As well the definition of a necessity appears to fail basic rational tests in a flawed system design; the panic over toilet paper remains a luxury for a large number on the planet - and one which is increasingly indefensible from an ecological perspective. These are red flags for those who assess security and risk at macro level. From a systemic (holistic) perspective it is actually insane. The intuitive loss of legitimacy suffered by the system (sovereign) is reflected by Krishnamurti:

>It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.

>~ Krishnamurti



Social Contracts have two interrelated components: the law provides and and social norms.; one . The other one, implicit, are social norms.
