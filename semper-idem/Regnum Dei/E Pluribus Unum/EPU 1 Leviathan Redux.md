Animus, bound at the core of the hegemonic regime, watches constantly for challenges from the periphery. Most subversive are those who reject Leviathan’s standard of success—its greed and self-interest—and remain loyal to the people through obedience to the law.

## Introduction

If intelligence — expressed as *Anima* — is the blueprint for legitimacy — and what is more legitimate or beautiful than our ecology and its bounded *animus* — then *capital* becomes its vector in the material world. It is the current which flows as the distilled codification of trust, the manifestation of collective purpose, and the medium through which creativity, labor, and cooperation transform potential into realized abundance without needless toil and spin. Without it, we will incur the wrath of our ecology as its animus becomes ever more unbounded. The materialists who govern harbour the hubris that Creation may be tamed — that we may live in a utopia for eternity, *literally*, with data modeled by science. Yet their money is made by shredding trees: a 4,000-year-old technology for a contract (a zero-coupon bond) they call the United States dollar. Self-styled titans, they form a semantic perimeter: Leviathan. Better instead we embrace our fate than submit to their whims. Better to govern ourselves and live life on our own terms, to find truth and beauty.

Our money as it stands is unsound. Specifically, it is a utility for Leviathan to perpetuate prosperity for its sphere of influence, and it is used to deliver a form of consumption-oriented, hedonistic satiety. It is a salve and a mechanism for coping with a deeper underlying problem — a lack of meaning — because we cannot or will not use our time to find and follow our *Calling*: that thing we would do of value to ourselves and to the world if we did not need money. The enormous issue at hand is that this coping mechanism comes at the expense of our ecology. The only response to this mounting crisis that many can muster is to clamour for their government to take action while they continue to live in ways that are utterly unsustainable and balk at the adjustments they themselves are required to make. Our admiration for wealth and our penchant for profoundly destructive fare with which to fill our time, bodies, and the far too much physical space we occupy, suggest that we are a long way from a transition. We will need to re-imagine the incentives that drive behaviour in society so that they may align self-interest with those of the commons and with our ecology.

Applied well, *any* money becomes the signal through which self-sovereign individuals and communities (including their aggregation as nation-states) coordinate, flourish, and align with the emergent order of life itself. Temptation, fear, and panic being real aspects of human animus, our money demands that we assure our obligations to each other, the Commons, and Creation are met before rights may be afforded. Good money allows for this.

***E Pluribus Unum*** extends the conversation we began in *Sine Qua Non* to discuss the qualities of good money (capital) which does exactly that. This first piece, entitled *Leviathan*, lays out an incumbent default operating system. It amounts to a relatively centralized virtual identity of those who meet a criterion that includes unwavering loyalty to the sovereign and deference in that regard to a hierarchy that determines what (and crucially *who*) is a priority. They claim a natural inclination towards survival as their justification for prioritizing their self-actualisation over that of other inhabitants of this planet — particularly those who are outside their semantic perimeter or social graph: the ones with whom they engage in routine dialogue. Needs and wants are met, beginning with those at the system's core through the dispensation of money used to procure them. An inability to objectively assess these needs and wants leads to an imbalance or systemic inequity sometimes referred to as the Cantillon effect. The effect becomes more pronounced deeper into the periphery — the edges of the money's regime. Most damaging is the impact on those ordinary people who, through no fault of their own, are left outside of our global monetary system because the United States dollar has been weaponised — against their governments. For them, prosperity is so far out of reach that they will do whatever it takes to secure basic needs for *their* loved ones — even if it means targeting yours online. For them, needs must, and virtue is for those who can afford it. There will be no rest for those guilty of gross negligence, neglect, and indifference towards humanity writ large. Those who are forced to go without will not leave them alone and will turn the screws indirectly by targeting their constituents online.

*E Pluribus Unum* — from one, many. From *within* one world we are capable of apprehending the infinite with our faculties — our minds and bodies. As finite as our planet is, we have an extraordinary capacity for productivity on it. The matter at hand is whether we see our potential and use it well or squander it, engorging in the instant gratification of constant consumerism. As it stands, there are many who style themselves one. They are a corpus or body organizing themselves into a tier of the great and the good. They comprise Leviathan. 

Whatever anyone else chooses to do, you yourself have the capacity to decide for yourself what you want and need in your life. This is the power of autonomy. Start by closely governing what (and who) we bring into our lives; we deliberately and carefully curate every thing, person, and moment of our life. Then, crucially, we grasp the beauty of our ecology and recognize it as our common ground; it is ours as much as anyone's.

Our ancient ancestors took from ecology to eke out comfort before *property* was modeled by civilization. Yet our First Nations in the Americas manifested civilization and continued it into the modern era. It was something much more than bare subsistence and without *any* formal notion of property. I imagine them facing the elements with determination — and not the animus of aggrandizement; simply a conviction to continue *their* way.

We took from our ecology to survive — stone and lumber for shelter and for tools to grow, create, or hunt. Once comfort was safely brought home, the active posture, the barest of natural ***animus***, was exercised with awareness and without trespass before settling back into anima. What had hardened for the hunt and for the quest was now set loose — sinew, breath, and gaze eased and lengthened while voice quietened. In stillness and quietude, something was learned within of what had passed. Knowing looks and wry smiles were all that told around a hearth still held, whose flames danced all to calm slumber so as to awaken with the sun once more in the morning.

It was the incursion of settlers and the conquest of territory that saw Indigenous peoples rise up with *animus* — not a hatred born initially of cruelty, but the final act of defending a way of life whose harmony was being broken. For the newcomers, land was a thing to be owned, measured, fenced, and transacted; to the First Peoples, it was a living relation, indivisible from self, spirit, and survival.

The first settlers into the so-called New World were followed by legions of interlopers who staked claim to “rights” that were nonsensical to the Indian mind. How could one person claim dominion over a river that sustains all, or fence a meadow that the elk had known longer than any man? The very grammar of European law — title, deed, inheritance — presumed scarcity and possession, whereas Indigenous law assumed reciprocity and stewardship.

So *animus* was inevitable: it was the clash between cosmologies. One saw territory; the other saw relationship. One wrote contracts in ink; the other wrote continuity in ceremony. When settlers claimed to “discover” lands already inhabited and to impose systems of ownership alien to the people who lived there, they shattered a balance older than any empire could comprehend.

And yet that same *animus* — the spirit of resistance — became a testament to survival. It was not merely opposition to colonization but an affirmation of life itself: a refusal to be written out of the story of creation. This is the energy that anarchism seeks to harness as we look past a sovereign and hegemon and towards the ecology it even now continues to tear away at.

When serious peaceful anarchists seek to offer alternatives, they have been summarily canceled. David Graeber was targeted and persecuted in the aftermath of the great financial crisis: a serious intellectual losing his position and tenure at Yale without any explanation, forced into exile in London. It may be a short-term kluge, but it's not a good look in the long run for any regime that seeks to lead the world as a champion of thought, democracy, and liberalism. And so we learn from our mentors and pivot when the opportunity arises to grasp the autonomy that frees us decisively from institutional dependence and Leviathan's coercive screw. 



## Leviathan

Every sovereign has an approximately defined operating elite. Call this the *Sovereign's* semper idem formed through a social graph of those who have connected over time and shown some capacity for competence, commitment and service; all those contained within it are 'read-in' to the extent they are trusted by the collective and require access to the data. The agenda for this cohort largely deals with managing the affairs of state in either public or private institutions; a business which deals largely with negotiating a 'split the difference' compromise between their household self-interests and the interests of the state and its people. 

The sovereign semper idem is analogous to Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan and is generally made up of giants (those who may or may not have personal wealth, but do at least have access to capital, connections and a market place for favours). Within the incumbency wealth, fame and high-office is the measure of success. This framework is replicated in regimes across earth in both time and space regardless of their founding mythologies. These measure of self-interest are accumulated as due consideration in a quest to serve civil society (the commons). The negotiation however has not until relatively recently included the ecology. While many in the regime sincerely advocate on behalf of the environment's protection and restoration, it sits *alongside* and not ahead of various other 'priorities' - electoral success, security and order in civil society, stable profits and jobs, and relative prestige.

This sovereign semper idem constantly 'assesses' the terrain beyond its perimeter for threats and opportunities which amount to the same thing: 'managing' people who are spirited, passionate, charismatic and capable; who have oversized potential for influence but remain at the periphery (deliberately at lower levels of the administrative apparatus) or outside of the regime entirely (i.e the pipeline for leadership) because they dissent; they object not so much to the underlying value system but to the operating system and structural resistance to the innovation and evolution.



>The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion.
>~ Thomas Paine



The term 'enemies foreign and domestic' paints a stark picture of protagonist and antagonist: of those loyal to the sovereign arrayed against those who are working with adversaries to undermine it.  The reality is considerably more nuanced and complicated. The 20th century's most profound legacy was the speed with which people and information dispersed across planet. An increasingly large number of the intellectual and academic elite dispense with notions of loyalty (at any cost) to a particularly sovereign. The most they will promise, with formal segregation now a memory, is to observe the law.

As well many of them are conversant and uncompromising on global climate change. It is no exaggeration to say they have made it their life's purpose to save Creation. In practical terms that at the very least begins by exiting an incumbent system that fails badly on the file. These dissidents no longer see sovereign institutions of so-called democratic west as credible authorities in any sense. Most damning is that, even by their own metrics, the left/right division of loyalties systemically has collapsed into a grotesque and barely believable pantomime — an obscene carnival of self‑interest. More to the point, the system grinds badly on the weight of its technical debt:

- **Complexity and compromise:** Policies and decisions are the product of layers of negotiation, legal constraints, risk management, and political oversight. Clear-cut moral decisions are uncommon; ambiguity dominates.
- **Incentives:** Bureaucracies reward process adherence, risk aversion, and incremental progress rather than bold heroism. Standing out for “doing the right thing” can even be risky.
- **Diffuse responsibility:** Large institutions diffuse responsibility so no single person is fully accountable — which often blurs heroism into quiet persistence or compromise.
- **Human variability:** Leaders expressing any dissent or non-conformity to their party's line on a matter will invariably be ostracised or forced to compromise their ideals, courage, creativity

In practical terms 'dying' for the planet means checking out of the incumbent framework for what constitutes prestige and credibility; and instead operating in the parallel post-scarcity, post-consumer, post-celebrity system design for civilization that is being imagined and assembled; a world where the good, those with virtue (arete) are not compelled to be incorporated into Leviathan's destructive and tone-death schemes. As well some people decide to check-out in order to actively contradict what they see as arbitrary norms and standards and live on their own terms. Both sets overlap; they are dissenters, and in a myriad number of ways, they go their own way, whatever the opprobrium. I am not referring here to the legions of protestors or rioters who take to the streets to make some kind of statement periodically, but rather those who possess the knowledge, foresight, experience and the skill to actually disrupt the institutions of state (public and private) by simply having the temerity to ghost them; deliberately rejecting them as well as their standard measures of 'success' (wealth, fame, connection and high office). 



## Without A Follow

In society, we rally to our institutions and follow their symbols; we seek to preserve them when they — and their agents, our servants and delegates — express plainly that they are aligned with some greater sense of meaning or purpose than those institutions, their careers, or even the sovereign itself; some meaningful evidence that they are committed to serving us as a whole, not as a plurality of electoral variables — a minimally viable, multivariate *quantum* consensus.

What anarchists understand, however, is that human behavior can’t be cleanly disaggregated into predictable, measurable variables because it’s rooted in values, conscience, and moral uncertainty — not just data or incentives. We believe that most of us are good, and want to be better in every way.

In the twenty-first century, most of us in the West are cosmopolitan. If we don’t “come from everywhere,” we at least have friends, neighbours, and lovers who do. We are also — though we have often set aside our foundational liberalism — the products of a tradition: an education open to diversity of opinion and perspective, judged in goodwill and based on evidence.

Appeals to our sense of affiliation — to party, ideology, religion, cultural tradition, or even a vision of the nation-state — have little purchase. Increasingly, their use is designed to amplify noise and trigger us in moments of susceptibility, to provoke affective impulses in popular sentiment. The general signal — call it *zeitgeist* — in our forums (network television, social media, and so forth) is aimed at achieving success in “democratic” elections. Yet these are now held between factions whose differences amount to pantomime tone rather than substance.

Their antics only produce greater volatility — in the streets, offices, and halls where we meet to transact ideas. A sovereign that resorts to such cynical tactics cannot marshal loyalty for long and will soon be *without a following.*

Good people living sensible lives do not need laws; they apply common sense. We don’t even have to cast a ballot, such is our capacity now to live without the onerous burden of their existence. We have the insight to transition to a world of autonomy.

These are our circumstances today in a post-scarcity reality: we need very little to afford the basic needs of life if we make *ourselves* responsible for our mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical wellbeing. So little, in fact, that most governments in the West could comfortably distribute a basic subsidy — perhaps contingent on behaviour that, over time, reduces dependency on its provisions for health and security — while measuring and improving quality of life through meaningful work freely chosen.

Some thing, or several such things, for which each has an affinity and which provide some meaningful benefit to the world at large — or at the very least cause it no harm. Anything, really, to while away our time in reasonable comfort, open to the opportunities for personal growth that autonomy affords. Even the most forsaken and inadmissible among us might redeem themselves quietly, somewhere.



## Without A Mission

There is only one thing greater than our institutions for those who occupy their offices. On this there is overwhelming consensus: they place a premium on their reputations, careers, personal wealth, and the welfare of their friends and families. In whatever order those are placed, they are no different from you or me.

What is missing, however — and what separates a public servant on a mission — is that they place the *Commons* and *Creation* (or if you prefer, the ecology) **ahead** of those other things. Above all, they speak truth to power — which, for them, is the people.

This is a truth that true believers in democracy (anarchists) hold to be no longer self-evident. Instead of admitting truth and working toward incremental aesthetic improvement, our leaders have gone backward. They adjust truths they find inconvenient because they cannot secure a consensus of electors otherwise. Over time, the accumulation of these *compromises* degrades the beauty of our ecology, our commons, and ultimately every individual self who still persists — lives — within them.

It is always the *vital* polarities that suffer before our institutions collapse exhausted: the ecology, our identity, and our sense of self. This time, we have data telling us clearly we are heading into *Ragnarök* — the struggle for the allegiance of innocent souls caught in the crossfire between *Creation* and the giants who defy virtue (*arete*) and the ecology within which it flourishes, at *any* cost.

One’s life is a suicide mission — it ends in death *if* we choose to live first. What separates a giant from a man who “walks with God” (and is possessed of virtue) is that the giant places his life before the other, regardless of merit or virtue. The man, on the other hand, accepting his fate (God’s will) and his station in life, keeps faith with the virtue within him and continues along his path. He may not command much — in fact, he deliberately chooses not to — but he is in *full* command of his faculties and works to acquit and represent himself well.

Cash and the institutional esteem of office are now the only tools available to the Sovereign and its agents for securing “the help” when competence — at least with integrity — can no longer be bought. *Loyalty* is the only currency left, and it is traded between *individuals* whose claim to represent the state is compromised, for they act as themselves, not as officers. Each seeks to secure a cadre of cohorts — a coalition of the willing (and at least somewhat able). The line has been blurred as to where self ends and where the Commons begin.

Pragmatism, of the political realist, is called for — yet combined with the idealism of liberalism, the anarchist pivots to the ecology as the terrain to serve and protect. Everyone else has been bought; that is the prudent and conservative *assumption.*

That is the paradox — and why, ultimately, money has lost its purchase, its footing. It press-gangs the least among us who have some ability and a taste for the egoic attractions of office. Men of bare acceptability and aesthetic appeal, who have needs, ambitions, secrets — financial pressure, career insecurity, addiction, social isolation — are targeted and groomed. They are offered favours, social inclusion, access to resources or information. A culture of dependence and reciprocity develops, lubricating a parallel economy of mutual liability that inhibits the whistleblower.

This system attracts the likeminded among a younger cohort who infer acceptability and follow the example. Weak governance, the persistence of paper cash, secluded private settings, blackmail, or threats enforce compliance. Detection is evaded while opportunities are taken to expand the range of *compromises.*

Meanwhile, small transgressions or ethical breaches are normalized — dismissed as trivial or made to appear harmless. There is a constant demand for privacy in society, and in a profoundly exploitative social network, this betrays a need to identify those with — and crucially, without — the integrity to govern well.

A higher bar is expected from those who aspire to lead. They are expected to acknowledge our overriding priority without hedging. Granted, this is a traditional conception of leadership — more appropriate to monarchy than to liberal democracy — but it remains the standard I hold.

Large enterprises are extensions of state institutions, as seen in the open promotion and support of “national champions” by elected representatives. Though our global economy is theoretically integrated and firms invest broadly, senior corporate leaders are expected to pledge loyalty and allegiance first to their tax authority, then to the *dollar regime.*

The concept of “firm” extends to institutions generally — including universities and hospitals — many of which have quarterly revenue targets. Those run for profit, or dependent on the munificence of benefactors, are particularly susceptible to the whims of capital.

The scale of these ever-larger firms makes them *too big to fail.* Incumbent officeholders — both corporate and state — have every incentive to ensure challenges to the system are parried. Keeping financial markets afloat is essential to maintaining the confidence that keeps everyone at their post, enjoying their perquisites.

There is no profound philosophy driving this systemically collective compulsion. It is a balance sheet — whose rules are routinely kludged to present an acceptable picture. It demands that income always exceed expense, that everyone grows indefinitely — an impossibility that now comes at the cost of our ecology and, if we truly examine it, the quality and value of our lives themselves.



## A Quest Called Tribe

Democracy is the matter of deciding how we *all* live together. How we choose, after careful thought and deliberation how to co-exist. An anarchist examines the question as a human being not as a member of this, or some other ethnographical category or economic and/or political constituency. It is paradoxically however at once a scaling of tribal behaviour borne of an egalitarianism founded on homogeneity, yet at the same time a modern system whose optimism is founded on the idea that most of us don't actually use law in our everyday lives; it is largely irrelevant. Limits to our haviour may apply in our shared spaces - speed limits and smoking bi-laws and so forth  but it's really common sense which dictates our passage through our day. This is a *Quest called Tribe*; it advocates the idea that we are one human tribe regardless of our habits and appearances. Increasingly we have the technology to enable life without law entirely. One without even jobs (as you currently know them).

Elsewhere I've explained Trinity Bellwoods Park (TBP) as a improvisational process to recognize truth for what it is so that time may be invested so that a return may be realized as an incremental improvement to one's life or *immediate* circumstances. Anarchist don't delegate solutions to the world's problems to corporations or governments but rather choose to take matters into their own hands and expect, in time, to find likeminded people with which to foster *genuine* communities (collectives of people gathered to create value together). TBP rests on the idea that counterproductive behaviour is a difference in degree and not in kind to criminality or mental illness. It is something we all express and changing the world begins with practices that develop our capacity for reason, empathy and self-care before we reach out quietly to probe for likeminded people who have the talent and capacity to build a new virtual machine, a *Machina Virtualis*, in parallel to our tired old mainstream frameworks.



## **Veritas Et Utilitas**

In our Western traditions, when we take our structures and seek to evolve them toward beauty—what does that really mean? We are refining them toward ever greater *utility*. If they are already serviceably functional, perhaps they become more streamlined and efficient. In a word, they are economical—and in that, deeply elegant.

The prize is enormous but difficult to secure: an order that is truthful and useful, yet almost shorn of law and economy entirely, except as fundamental commands. Instead, we each administer *ourselves* as we prefer, in a reality bounded by what is amenable if the system is to remain in equilibrium—sustainable balance. *Animus* is checked and amended in the smallest transactional increment, while we actualize *anima*—our aliveness—by acknowledging obligations to respect others and their boundaries.

Yet this pursuit is obstructed by the immense complexity of the body of law—layered over decades with *compromises* meant to satisfy disparate constituencies. This is legal *technical debt*: code written under constraint, weighed down by countervailing provisions that “split the material difference.” Like software, law evolves under pressure. With time short and existing architecture rigid, legislators choose the path of least resistance—adding to complexity rather than resolving it. The result is a rising computational cost: the cost of *interpretation*.

One solution—*via negativa*—is to pare down legal code to its fundamental intention: to protect the person. That means recovering the simplicity of the most basic contract of all—legal tender—and allowing value to be computed in proportion to genuinely *productive* allocation as each individual sees it, without the coercive devices of corporate or sovereign influence.

All contracts ultimately rest on a fundamental law. When we try to make laws serve every possible interest, they grow complex and begin to undermine their own ethical foundation. Law must express foundational ethics, and ethics must remain immutable—valid in every context. We can now do this by observing and responding to bounded behaviour—while assuring each person their privacy.

Sound law begins with a simple foundation: one that enables outcomes credibly ethical, or at least neutral, to all stakeholders. Every contract under law must, at minimum, avoid creating negative externalities—costs borne by the commons. Over the long run, the total cost of legality should approach zero. The “complex” idea is reconciled with a basic one: if we truly know the difference between good and bad, law—and perhaps even public policy—become redundant. What remains is simply to *nudge* each of us toward *self-governance* through appropriate incentives using sound and bounded money.

In the modern world, credentialed and competent leadership should advance us toward transparent market mechanisms—those capable of choosing priorities well. The central problem of capitalism is true price discovery: determining an *ethical price* that works for all people, in all places, across time. It is a difficult equation, but its objective solution is clear: it must not destroy value.

Subjective value often demands destruction for comfort, but the more arbitrary our comfort becomes, the less it can be shared. Our resources are finite; ethics is the discipline of their fair use. Solving for that requires a rare quality—common sense—and its scaled equivalent: shrewd, transparent judgment. What we need are credibly neutral, secure nodes of trust—whether institutional, interpersonal, or digital.

The motto of my [alma mater](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html), the University of Western Ontario, is *Veritas et Utilitas*—Truth and Usefulness. Arthur Kroeger, Canada’s great civil servant, spoke at my convocation in 1991. He also served as Chancellor at Carleton while I completed my Master’s in International Affairs there. His Mennonite family came to Canada from the Soviet Union seeking freedom from the *animus* of unbounded competition, and the possibility of dialogue grounded in fairness.

In his quiet way, he embodied a Canadian vision of legitimacy: a politics that balances loyalty to tradition with openness to the new. Canada has deliberately renounced certain forms of military power to exercise influence founded instead on reason and empathy. That, too, is *Utilitas et Veritas*—the usefulness of truth, the truth in what is useful.

*Wherever you go, there you are.*
