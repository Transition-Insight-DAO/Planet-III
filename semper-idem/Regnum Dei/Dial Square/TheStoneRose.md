**Artwork**:  The Stone Rose: The earth was once a barren stone that flowered, bringing forth humanity. This flowering represents the Square of the Dial Square — a fractal form that mirrors both the individual self and the greater whole we call society. The Square holds atop the Dial (Our Glass), representing reason and objectivity, and within it rests the Yoga Element (Lingam), symbolizing introspection and intuition. Society, through evolving mechanisms of governance, is tasked with stewarding the commons. As we accumulate and share insight, we move toward a new earth — one where self-actualized custodians, both individual and collective, maintain creation in equilibrium.

## Made of Stone

We are modeling a framework for governance, Regnum Dei, that recognizes an individual's need for pluralistic self-actualization while acknowledging our collective responsibility as custodians of creation. Our model is the Dial Square, and here we explore the Stone Rose, asking: What does it take for one to become someone you can live with?

In an anarchic framework that seeks to express a systems design capable of scaling into a political economy; one that grants contentment in material terms, that question is the starting point and a foundational inquiry that shapes how resilient systems are built and sustained.

The Square is the outward expression of the self with an innate capacity for utilizing reason and intuition for creative expression; a flourish that holds promise as the Stone Rose. Consider the barren earth with its nascent chemical and thermal potentiality. The planet came into being some four billion years ago and then one morning just after sunrise some 114 million years ago, [Eckhart Tolle](https://www.amazon.ca/New-Earth-Awakening-Purpose-Selection/dp/0452289963/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1) relates 'the first flower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. He goes on to ask:

*Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner flowering so radical and profound that compared to it the flowering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale reflection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of materialism and materiality and rise above identification with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to imprisonment within their own personality?*

In the story of The Flower Sermon the Buddha, holds a flower before his disciples and remained silent. His disciple Mahākāśyapa smiled in response, recognizing the silent teaching. This story embodies the idea that true understanding is both rational and intuitive (requiring openness and empathy - intuitive optimism). It cannot be found through pure reason alone which at its core is simple arithmetic shorn of empathic humanist preferences. When you understand this, you even struggle to use the word 'rational' or 'reason' for the purely mathematical calculus because it seems so unreasonable.

A visually stunning cross-section of a Sequoia (left) made a lasting impression when I visited London's [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/) as a child. It was still there when I took my eldest daughter, Dhara, to see it a couple of decades ago. I stood in awe of its size and imagined myself bearing witness to the unfolding of human history as that tree did. You can make out the various milestone (our greatest hits and misses) in the photograph. 'Was it an unravelling or or flowering?

Whatever humanity's prospects the tree was itself a silent witness. It faced reality and seized the day dispassionately and without judgement, creating itself without spinning and without toil, each ring a layering 'tell' incrementally creating a story of its journey taken without complaint through life.

The Stone Rose above is made of 'Ls' interlocked tightly with intention and purpose. Value is often discovered , [via negativa](https://coffeeandjunk.com/via-negativa/), by *losing* that which is extraneous. As well these are the Ls I dropped, ever the cockney boy inside the man, with my Gujarati [*tev* ](https://transition-insight.com/research-%26-writing/f/call-me?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination))( તેવ - habits) -  the heritage and culture of habits make a mound (tells) within, and as well, without as when I helped build that wonderwall with deliberate slowness out near Campbellford all those years ago. They ensure that Jack amounts to a hill of beans. As I see it you and I both are in this modern world made of Londinium; it comes through the alchemy made living in the relative elegance and vibrance of the west, represented to me by that metropole at the core (0-UTC) that teems with culture even as it sucks the life out of me, and the money from my pocket. I'm still left with 'dignity honey' because I grow from the experience and become like the tree, or the contemplated flower, or even yet the lilies in the field, less prone to toil and spin; I accept with equanimity what is - and more so, given the weather in London, a sense of gratitude just for *having* weather. This is stoic optimism. This optimism of the Square (Stone Rose) is called stoicism. To be stoic is not to passively or fatalistically receive the diem (day) but instead to make something of the diem materially. This requires presence; to Stop, Think, Observe, Intuit, Create (STOIC) upon that which is in front of us - and quite often that means not doing anything at all and moving on to something that resonates moving you closer to your Calling. This realization takes time during which you swing like a pendulum revelling in gratitude and discovery of calling as you turn away from an profoundly sick society:

Good times gone, and you missed them What's gone wrong in your system? Things they bounce like a Spaulding What'd you think, did you miss your calling? It's so free, this kind of feeling It's like life, it's so appealing When you've got so much to say it's called gratitude And that's right

~ The Beastie Boys (Gratitude)

The alternative to gratitude and the stoic optimism of acceptance amounts to the slow drip euthanasia of DECAY (dutifully executing conventional activities yieldlessly). This is a space in which even creatively contemplative soul who has no struggle with 'earn' still yet 'yearns' for a world where justice just is. He forgets reason and succumbs to his intuitive empathy, finding solace knowing it all ends in the peace that comes to all of us. He even tumbles headlong into it like a roiling stone in search of purchase, any footing at all - that stillness and a final release from the hegemon's self-interested special purpose vehicle plowing indiscriminately through humanity with its soft-power corrosion of *any kind* of purchase power:

And on my deathbed I will pray To the gods and the angels Like a pagan to anyone Who will take me to heaven To a place I recall I was there so long ago The sky was bruised The wine was bled And there you led me on 

~ Audioslave (Like A Stone)

The Stone Rose - Generation X It

Anarchy has enormous cultural depth quite simply because it is open to fusion and instinctively shuns bias (say economic racism - nationalism of any kind - usually in the guise of flag-waving patriotism - an easily digested soma for 'democratically' inducing the peoples' coma) by walking away. Here's an example from Beck. 

You can't write if you can't relate Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite That's choking on the splinters

~ Beck (Loser)

You create nothing of value if you can't relate with notions that offer fair equivalence. You're just trading your precious time for bogus cash to fuel the military-industrial hate machine and you struggle with that reality because you know you're just a pest on the giant's table choking on whatever paltry fragments you can scrounge.

**The Stone Rose Scaled for Governance**

I use the metaphor of the **Stone Rose** to represent how individual actions—'live' transactions in reality—accumulate over time, shaping who we are. These actions, or 'put tels,' form a mound that reflects our presence in the commons, where they are logged and assessed for validity. In this system, self-representation is an ongoing process of alignment with collective truth:

> You can't hide from the truth Because the truth is all there is Ceteris paribus, my modus operandi Is carpe diem whether de facto or de jure, comprende? Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later Stenographers are steady logging the jargon That your counselors are barking, in hopes of a plea bargain Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with Live will ~ Handsome Boy Modeling School (*The Truth*)

> There are limits of course to any model. In reality our transactional behaviour is constant with some being transitory or even random; but the continuous flow elaborates a pattern of behaviour that eventually become persistent aspects of identity and personality that constitute the self (a private key if you will) and *these* become 'tels' over time. Whether analog or digital these are measured by the commons which develops a more or less complete sense of who that self is (a public key). The mapping of these 'keys' allows the one and the commons to NAVIGATE (lingam)* in a constantly productive (i.e. fertile) 'discussion' to manage alignment of interests and even incrementally incentivize behaviour to that end.

**The Dial Square As A Model For Governance**

Rather than anchoring governance discussions in the technical details of **proof-of-stake**, I frame the **Dial Square** as a design philosophy that aligns self-interest with the commons. This approach does not mandate a single protocol—plurality allows a marketplace of ideas to determine 'winners' while fostering a resilient ecosystem. However, for these governance models to thrive, they must remain interoperable to maintain their niche relevance.

A useful analogy is **Ethereum's Layer-2 ecosystem**, where multiple protocols specialize in optimizing transactional data. Some batch transactions via rollups, others use state channels, and some compress data to maximize efficiency. The unifying principle is fairness—mechanisms that prevent exploitative practices while ensuring that individuals and the commons benefit in tandem. These protocols derive security from **Ethereum’s Layer-1**, preserving integrity and verifiability across networks.

**Core Principles of The Stone Rose**

- **Permanence and Balance**: Like dry-stone architecture, this system emphasizes trust through structure, not coercion. Transactions are assumed valid unless proven otherwise, ensuring efficiency while maintaining fairness.
- **Proof-of-Stake as a Trust Mechanism**: Verified identities act as foundational stones—solid nodes maintaining network integrity. Incentives favor constructive behavior, making exploitative tactics structurally inefficient.
- **Prioritizing the Commons' Interests**: Transactions that align with collective well-being receive preferential settlement terms—just as a dry-stone structure distributes pressure for balance. Self-interest and social good are not opposing forces but intertwined; prosperity arises from contributing to system stability.

There are limits of course to any model. In reality our transactional behaviour is constant with some being transitory or random - and there may be explicably 'aberrant to trend behaviour' (to be expected as thing are in this world); but the continuous flow elaborates a pattern of behaviour that eventually become persistent aspects of identity and personality that constitute the self (a private key if you will) and 

*NAVIGATE  (lingam): **N***oun (name)* **A***nd* **V***erb (action)* **I***dentity (now abstracted)* **G***uarded* **A***gainst* **T***he* **E***xploitative* *-* affording protection respectively to the self and to the commons encompassing contextual subjectivity. Exploitative is used here in the granular as well as obvious sense of *any* use of self-sovereign person (including data) without consent being *contextually* secured and due consideration being *implicitly* offered and received. At some point (smart) contracts should be derivable contextually. Lingam in Sanskrit denotes generative power (productivity or in the traditional spiritual context fertility - hence the reference to flowering of a Stone Rose). We'll take a look at the distillation process in Dial: Our Glass as well as explore the constant discussive assessment of equivalency in The Yoga Element: Lingam.
