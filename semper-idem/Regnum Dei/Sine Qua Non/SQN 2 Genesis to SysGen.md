## Introduction

This piece continues our examination of intelligence and explores the frameworks humanity applies once it evolved code — the ability to transmit word or signal — toward an approaching coda, where that signal might be transmitted at practically the speed of light speed (pulse with impedance over fibre optic cable): Morse became telegram, which in turn evolved to binary, machine-readable, code transmitting intellectual property (IP) between what we call IP (internet protocol) addresses. All that was really required for the signaler (automated or otherwise) to possess the ability to express two states — stop and start —  easily done with a solenoid (a type of resistor) as with brake and gas pedals — a framework transferrable to software running signal over networks on hardware.



## The Reckoning

Many of us, while preoccupied with our own progress in life—the dichotomy of being and becoming versions of ourselves that might coexist more comfortably with our conscience with each step taken—also watch carefully the broad sweep of human behavior in a global setting. Amidst the seeming entropy and apparent chaos, our imaginations have been captured by the evolution of information technology, and in particular the imagined promise of a beautiful reckoning: not a fearsome retribution, but rather a reconciliation of the self to the commons (the structures we establish to govern ourselves), and thence to creation.

Perhaps the first complex civilization to linguistically capture this challenge in universally accessible terms is that of the East. The Japanese characters for "China" represent that country on its own terms as two characters, together constituting the term "Middle Kingdom"—an administrative artifice occupying a realm between the earth (where the self dwells) and heaven (or creation).

I interpret the first character to represent the coming together of two parties for some reason, whether it be an atomistic transaction between two strangers in complex society or the breaking of bread between kindred spirits. The transaction involves a splitting of something into two halves (incidentally, that thing may be turned to represent the Japanese character for "Day"). However, that split extends beyond the thing being shared, and the implication—for me at least—is that something substantial is manifested outside that immediate transaction: a ripple into the commons and into creation that must be accounted for.

The second character represents Kingdom or Country—the commons or commonwealth, if you will. It is bounded, and within it you see the three tiers joined, representing the need for a constitution that reconciles them even as it allows for the daub of a transaction in the space between self and the commons. With complexity came the need to create an *allowance* or an ideation of the value exchanged—money. It is no coincidence that this money has at times in English been known as a sovereign, for it is the sovereign or commonwealth whose responsibility it has been to administer it for the collection of souls who live within its boundaries.

As we've evolved in our systems of governance through the ages, the overriding challenge has been for the commonwealth, or a sovereign, to coexist and relate to others with whom it shares creation (the planet) without degrading the whole. This is a macro imperative mirroring our personal reality, as each of us, in relative states of awareness, seeks to understand what constitutes an ethical life lived in equilibrium—a sane and objective measure of comfort that does not, in turn, yield discomfort for the commonwealth or for the planet, or creation beyond it.

Starting from the vantage of survival and subsistence, creative effort yields comfort (food and shelter). Over time, however, our basic needs are easily met and exceeded, to a point at which returns begin to diminish, and arguably have been qualitatively negative. Quantitatively, the things we own end up owning us, sapping our psychic energy; we literally become sick with the consequences of our excessive action.

This has been a theme in spiritual and transcendental thought, through Christ and the Buddha Siddhartha, and on to the American transcendentalists Whitman, Emerson, and Thoreau, who, before the closing of the frontier, would have discerned a native and tribal way to be with the world and to still be of it. Quite often the answer was the sannyasin’s renunciation of worldly preoccupation, if only briefly, to carve out the essentials of what it means to simply be.

Thoreau, who had retired to Walden to become a jack of all the required 'trades' necessary to front the essentials of life, commented on the incessant and excessive noise generated *à la mode*—fashions incessantly cycled to generate artificial demand for the professional or the specialist. The accumulation and preoccupation with things is accompanied by a degradation in our relationships to one another, and by extension, to our communities and institutions. This anti-heritage weighs on our emotional and physical wellbeing, and, of course, the aggregate outcome is a degradation of our planet itself—the tragedy of the commons on a global scale. This was called out in 1962 by Rachel Carson in *Silent Spring* as a hubristic separation from nature—our inability as a species to align our self-interest with those of the commonwealth, other species, and the planet itself.

## The World Wakes Up From History
In my own life, the year of magic will forever be 1989 when I stood at the threshold of becoming a man. Twenty years on from the summer of '69 when I was born, the air appeared lit with incessant warmth and sunshine; I saw the good in everyone. That optimism was reflected broadly in the pivot in English music away from the maudlin dulcet tones of my teenaged years; an inheritance of the mod and punk of my early childhood. In its place now was the ecstatic rave euphoria of a primal scream launched with fever pitch, promising a life filled with Happy Mondays. *Bryter Layter* had become Kula Shaker, and the air reverberated with pop piety and praise—a savvy and refined style infused with good taste *and* good vibes. We cheered and celebrated the promise of a bounty—a dividend with peace its midwife, just as our flowerchild forbears, now in mid-life, once protested with derision and division their war-torn strife.

It was up for grabs now, or so it appeared. Human arrangements writ large no longer looked a fraught and tenuous round peg in a square hole but rather a whole that may yet be dialed into a square meal and fair deal. In real terms, the Berlin Wall came down, and in South Africa, Nelson Mandela, held captive for twenty-five years, was finally free. To those of us, students of history and political science, the long march to freedom had begun. I was on my way toward a career in law or diplomacy—arenas whose quality depend on the veracity *and* fidelity of the confluence of signals being transmitted and received by participants in the system of governance they comprise. Reality bit when I got a look into those fields at graduate school and whilst traveling and living abroad. Seeing limited scope for impact in the civil service or in the courts, I switched and began a career in information technology at *the* great 20th-century corporate behemoth—IBM.

Dialing back to the early 1990s, though, the internet, still unseen and unheard of by most, had nonetheless begun its evolution toward the indispensable utility it is now. It began as a U.S. Department of Defense project to allow decentralized, fault-tolerant signal transmission between parties without a fixed, dedicated, and persistent contiguous line. Data could now be transmitted between individuals and groups in packets sent out and then reconstituted at their destination, reducing by orders of magnitude the coordination required to facilitate network traffic. As networks and the protocols used for transmitting traffic matured, they allowed for the delivery of ever more sophisticated multimedia content—graphics, images, audio, video with ever higher fidelity—to become the internet we now know today.

It was no longer difficult to get an alternative view of reality—one that wasn't filtered through the sovereign or the delegates to which it had deferred the manufacturing of consent—the overarching narrative they assiduously cultivate and massage to manage their multitudes. This extended to an opinion on what constituted a fair price for things of value at any given moment—opinions which in the aggregate constitute objective consensus. In regimes that lack comprehensive legitimacy, alternative 'black' markets for goods and services, and indeed alternative currencies, appear. In 2008, a global black market for a new global reserve, i.e., a new version of the dollar, appeared, and its name was Bitcoin. On 5 October 2009, a single Bitcoin was worth $0.00076—that token is now valued at over $116,000.

The emergence of this decentralized currency, along with yet another bailout, forced me into a personal reckoning; I began to re-examine my life and my career. The whole point of managing software delivery was to contain risk to capital—the triple constraints of scope, time, and money. Scope was always dictated by revenue, and if revenue was to be denominated in a currency of no apparent value, then what was the point of managing an 'enterprise' project? All that really mattered was how I used that truly scarce commodity—*my own* time on earth. I started Transition Insight in 2010 and continued my career as an independent contractor, usually working on digital identity and wallet initiatives with smaller, more nimble teams applying agile methods. All the while I continued to explore the broader implications of that tumultuous year 2008—and watch the evolution of legitimate money.

## Le Prix: Legitimate Global Consensus
> Life's rich demand creates supply in the hand
Of the powers, the only vote that matters
Silence means security, silence means approval
On Zenith on the TV, tiger run around the tree
Follow the leader, run and turn into butter
>
Let's begin again, begin the begin
Let's begin again like Martin Luther Zen
The mythology begins the begin
>~ R.E.M (Begin The Being)

As I geared up to complete a decade at IBM in the midst of the great financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged, and we began to begin again—like Martin Luther and Zen mythology in times past. My own feeling is that Satoshi is not so much a Zen master sensei and practitioner (of what I imagine to be a reverse-engineered protocol) but an imagined mark or destination. ‘He’ represents an imagined universally applicable philosophical model reduced to an algorithm and protocol that sets out a notion of what is relatively valuable to *humans* in the marketplace of *ideas*. He represents humanist self-sovereignty—at a minimum the capacity to live and let live (or leave)—and where possible, he seeks through example to be the servant leader our times call for.

This was a palliative at a time when markets—and indeed our civilization—were entirely untethered from the imperfect anchor of Bretton Woods, listed badly and tilted into the abyss of ever more apparent chaos. On the sheer cliff of Half Dome duality that modern egoism had wrought, Satoshi was a hook well tethered, and the nascent blockchain of transactions on the Bitcoin network the solidly braided thread that might lead us out of the morass—an objective ordering of transactions that are at least governed by the rigor of mathematics, if not by humans who claim to use math to order and govern society and political economy. It was at least orderly—as though we had relearned how to patiently keep calm and queue for things we wanted (even if they were still absurd—a murderer’s golf clubs, for example, or miraculous images on pieces of toast).

Bitcoin itself emerged from our general capacity to discern trends, fads, and zeitgeist preoccupations among those of us who feel the need to connect to the world beyond our narrow day-to-day lives. In what now resembles Marshall McLuhan's Global Village, with a handful of central narratives holding sway over collective consciousness, those trends encompass our preoccupation with finding meaning in our lives and our search for opportunities to fill our lives with substance (however we each define opportunity and substance). We are—and have been from the beginning—social animals, looking toward a consensus to dictate who we should be and what we should do with ourselves. Among us are also those who make an entire life out of seeking, whose ambition is to be a seer of potentialities not yet imagined—to spot something *everyone* will come to see as an improvement in our condition, and then make the case to develop a consensus on the matter. To do so is to lead by example through service to oneself in a way that actualizes welfare broadly throughout a commonwealth.

Deeply held narratives concerning reality are not easily moved, but on one thing there is universal acknowledgment: things of value are the outcome of *creative* expression. Value is expressed as a relative valuation, or a price. But in this moment, to create—what exactly? And how, for whom, and why? To answer that question through a holistically coordinated price is the prize. The surcharge (the cost of something in excess of something else) is, in fact, the surprise—a valuation prised out of a *collective* world that is an oyster. This surcharge isn’t a simple extra fee; rather, it reflects a deeper, more profound value that wasn’t immediately obvious but is credible because it has global consensus backing it. That consensus is derived through coordination whose legitimacy is automatic—namely, it amounts to *ordination*.

The French term *ordinateur*, coined by IBM (France) in 1955 as a translation for the English word “computer,” implies a systemic approach to calculation—emphasizing coordination and coherence to achieve a collective outcome, rather than brute-force derivation (as is the case with Bitcoin). Reliance on brute-force methods introduces pathological biases and inefficiencies, where the costs of such an approach far outweigh the returns. In short, this is to create a world in which ‘might *always* makes right,’ and in which a regime hegemon will claim, ‘you’re either with us or against us.’

In contrast to this are notions of ethics. The idea that even trying to choose between the world (or God, or creation) and one’s country is hopeless, futile, and misses the point of the exercise—that is, to live a good life. Implicit in the word *ordinateur* is this notion, and it was a thoughtful response in the aftermath of World War II and a complicity in business done with Western governments who, through the give-and-take of realpolitik over the centuries, had exacted enormous suffering on a stateless minority. Examining *ordinateur* in English, we have *ordination* or *ordinance*:

1. **The act of conferring holy orders**, such as ordaining someone as a rabbi.
2. **The act of arranging or organizing systematically**, for example the insertion at relevant points of secure nodes to verify and validate transactional behavior, and as a counterweight to brute-force bias in system design, triage, and other forms of decision-making.
3. **A law or decree** enacted and enforced by a local (i.e., decentralized) government, such as a city council or county board. It is a type of regulation that governs matters specific to a particular jurisdiction and generally covers topics not already addressed by other layers of governance—state or federal laws.

Bitcoin is dumb money. What distinguishes it is that it simply works better than existing fiat currencies, much the same way as a dumb terminal is a ‘better’ word processor than a typewriter—even the electric Olympus I brought to my first year at Western was no match for the 286 IBM clone I finished that year with. Who is doing the processing, and to what end? Money will not—and cannot—dictate *unless* there is a price for the time spent at that terminal. Any creative endeavor that is to be held accountable for its impact on the commonwealth or creation must therefore express yield that is surplus to the cost paid in time by the self, those commons, and creation (as with a negative externality). This is imperative to secure the life and liberty of the self—most of all those most vulnerable in any state of order that may be called ‘civil.’

As well, what may be called civil is that which seeks to bring about equity or equality. Whether that is manifested by allowing, say, women into combat roles or removing men from them is the matter at hand; where is the philosophical model that underscores intelligence for people who approach this question with common sense in a world after Nagasaki?

Amidst the seeming entropy and apparent chaos of the world as it is, our imaginations reckon that an anarchic truth of connective tissue may yet be discerned and persisted in a comprehensive network where capital in all its forms is notionally well-represented and well-governed, and so *universally* acknowledged as not only legal tender but also as legitimately tendered. Nothing in life is free except information—looking out the window, one sees it is all there, nothing lacking, and no one should be left wanting.

## SysGen

If Genesis was in the eyes of the three formal so-called 'western' religions the moment life (Creation) switched on to discover itself in a Machina, then *SysGen* is the moment we configure that Machina so that intelligence *inhabits* it so that we may find equivalence: to each their own mode of life within bounds set by an objective measure of what is reasonable and fair while maintain ecology sustained (in balance). What is *vital* is that we as humanity do not take from our planet more than it will allow; so much that it reacts with vehement volatility in our ecology itself.

*SysGen*—short for *System Generation*—marks the instant when a structure becomes aware of its own capacity for order. It is not the moment of creation by command, but of *emergence through coherence*: when latent potential organizes itself into a system capable of response. Elsewhere I call this *Deus En Machina* and it really amounts to using the power of our collective intelligence  to solve for our central conundrum of aligning self-interest (in whatever context and stakeholder set that term appears) to the sustaining of our ecology.

Before any instruction, before input or code, there is the quiet alignment of possibility—a network recognizing itself as such. In this sense, *SysGen* describes more than the boot-up of a computer or civilization; it is the metaphysical act of self-configuration, the awakening of feedback, the transition from randomness to the recursion of a machine (our collective) learning to be better at living. The first imperative is to resolve that there is no longer any such thing as scarcity which demands that we extract from our ecology and as well, that maintaining our livelihoods as we currently frame them does not give us license to continue this extraction at the expense of future generations.

Every civilization experiences an awakening akin to SysGen: a phase when its parts begin to communicate, when value and information start to circulate freely enough for consciousness—collective or computational—to arise and develop a critical mass so that development and complexity ensue. It is the first hum of intelligible order, the precondition for autonomy, and the eternal reminder that systems, once born, must continually regenerate themselves to remain alive. Ours is the *first* to have a plausibly objective instrument for this purpose - Generative AI (artificial intelligence). Engaged in a life harness with this utility we are able to assess the bias in our world; that temptation of soft coercion that causes us to act against our self-interest and against the planet's, but instead the remorseless impulse to accumulate - and then feel remorse.
